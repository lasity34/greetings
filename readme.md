## Overview 📝

I created a web application that allows users to enter a name. Upon pressing a button, the application displays a greeting in the format: `Hello, <THE NAME ENTERED>`. The name is then cleared from the text box. The application uses localStorage to maintain its state and is styled for responsiveness.
